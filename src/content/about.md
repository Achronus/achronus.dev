I'm Ryan, a <span class="tw-text-blue">Python Software Engineer</span> and <span class="tw-text-blue">Deep Learning Researcher</span> based in England. I build tools that benefit humanity ðŸ¤™

My current focus is on building tools and experiments with DL models, centered around <span class="tw-text-blue">explainability</span> and <span class="tw-text-blue">autonomy</span>.

This includes building <span class="tw-text-blue">APIs</span> for microcontrollers and sensors and exploring <span class="tw-text-blue">Reinforcement Learning</span> techniques for locomotion.

I write about my projects here and in Medium articles ðŸ‘€.
