is a framework for Liquid Reinforcement Learning (Liquid RL). It uses Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) focusing on control tasks combined with RL techniques. LNNs are powerful Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that learn system dynamics, not just patterns. The framework combines them with Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs) to make powerful, small-scale, sparsely connected, explainable architectures.
