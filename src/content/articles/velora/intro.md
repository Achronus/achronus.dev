For the past two years, Machine Learning has focused on large-scale models (e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs)) with the belief that scale is the only way to achieve great-performing models. This ends up costing billions of dollars and massive amounts of greenhouse gases sent into our atmosphere. I would argue, this is a main contributing factor to the increased natural disasters we’ve experienced and has really made me question the viability of these types of models.

Furthermore, scale becomes extremely difficult to explain how a model makes its predictions. How do we expect to build reliable, critical systems that are safe to use if we cannot understand them? This poses two major questions:

1. Can we build small-scale powerful models?
2. Can we make models more explainable?

I believe both are achievable and this framework follows my journey on exploring that. To keep things simple, we focus on solving one domain: locomotion control problems. Robotics systems need to be explainable to be effective and widely used in the public domain. I believe they are an essential tool that will help us solve large-scale challenges like food shortages, and as a first step, motion is the best place to start. Robots are useless if they cannot effectively navigate our world!

My plan is to focus on these types of models and compare them against state-of-the-art RL techniques to identify their viability. I’ll be building the models myself using PyTorch, so I can deeply understand them and adapt them when needed. I’ve got a few ideas for additional RL techniques I want to explore too that are not really discussed, some hidden gems perhaps.

It’s going to be a long project but will provide me with some very interesting insights! Hopefully, I can provide some to the community too!
