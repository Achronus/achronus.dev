Over the past year Iâ€™ve found myself creating the same style Python projects over and over again.

Create a new folder, create a Python virtual environment, install Poetry, create the package files and install the right dependenciesâ€¦ It's exhausting! ðŸ¥±
This sparked a new idea -

> *"Why don't I just automate the process?"*

Iâ€™d already built a few CLI tools such as [Zentra](https://github.com/Achronus/Zentra) (I know, it needs an update!), so I was already familiar with some of the foundational concepts. Mulling it over, the whole creation process was extremely painful so I had to automate the process, and fast.

I didn't want to spend the next month working on it so it had to be quick and dirty, something I could build in a weekend. That would mean restrictions:

- No unit tests
- No fancy commands nor extremely fancy logic
- No data validation (R.I.P. [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) ðŸ˜­)
- No logging
- Limited documentation - install and running only

I'd still need a package manager, so [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) isn't going anywhere (`requirements.txt` just doesn't cut it for me!), version control (ðŸ’• GitHub), and some CI for publishing to PyPI. Recycling Zentra's GitHub workflows is good enough.
Now for the tool itself, one command would do the trick! A simple `create` command works.

Okay, letâ€™s do this! ðŸš€
