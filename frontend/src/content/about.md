I was raised in the small town of Colchester, where my programming adventure started during an apprenticeship. Focusing on front-end development and assisting in creating full-fledged WordPress websites, I found my love for problem-solving and building applications from the ground up.

After 4 years, I craved something new and moved away from web development. Pursing new career options, I enrolled in the <span class="tw-text-blue">University of Lincoln</span > to obtain my BSc degree in <span class="tw-text-blue">Computer Science</span>. In between assignments, I began taking online <span class="tw-text-blue">Udacity</span> and <span class="tw-text-blue">Udemy</span> courses, where I discovered a passion for <span class="tw-text-blue">Machine Learning</span> and <span class="tw-text-blue">AI</span>.

I continued my journey through an MSc degree in <span class="tw-text-blue">Machine Learning and Autonomous Systems</span> at the <span class="tw-text-blue">University of Bath</span>.

Personally, I love programming ![code](../assets/imgs/icons/code.png) and playing chess ![chess](../assets/imgs/icons/chess.png), and enjoy listening to music ![music](../assets/imgs/icons/spotify.png) or watching a movie ![movie](../assets/imgs/icons/movies.png) when relaxing.

Currently, I spend most of my time building tools in <span class="tw-text-blue">Python</span> and exploring research in <span class="tw-text-blue">Deep Learning</span>, primarily in <span class="tw-text-blue">locomotion</span> and <span class="tw-text-blue">small-scale models</span>. I strongly believe that models should be small and powerful, not large and powerful. I aim to help make that a reality.
